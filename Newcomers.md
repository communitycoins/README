## 👋 For newcomers

Welcome to **CommunityCoins**.

This Forgejo instance is an **open library of software and infrastructure**
maintained by multiple teams working on community-driven cryptocurrencies
and shared tooling (wallets, SPV infrastructure, documentation, governance).

### What you will find here

The platform is organised by **domains**, not by individuals:

- **Core wallets**  
  Full-node daemons, CLI tools, and wallet-related code

- **SPV infrastructure**  
  Lightweight verification, indexing, networking, and monitoring

- **Documentation & governance**  
  Architecture notes, design decisions, and coordination material

Each domain lives in its own **organization**.  
Inside organizations you’ll find **repositories**, which are the long-lived technical assets.

> 🔎 Tip  
> Start from the organisation pages rather than the global “Explore” view.
> They give you a curated overview per domain.

### Visibility & openness

All public organizations and repositories are:
- readable without an account
- browsable by anyone
- open for discussion via issues

You only need an account if you want to:
- open issues
- comment
- propose changes

### What *not* to expect

This platform is **not** organised as:
- a single monolithic project
- a task tracker first
- a “finished product” showcase

It is a **living codebase**, with repositories evolving over time.

If you’re unsure where to start:
- read the README of a repository
- check its Issues tab
- or return to the Navigation page for orientation
