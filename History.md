## Forgejo as the Primary Coordination Source for CommunityCoins

Originally created in 2021, a GitLab repository hub for CommunityCoins
(https://gitlab.com/c4319) was as a practical solution of two earlier efforts to consolidate proceedings:

- an intermediary based on Sandstorm (https://sandstorm.org), and
- a previous GitLab setup (https://gitlab.com/Communitycoins1).

At the time, GitLab offered a convenient and accessible platform for collaboration. However, over the years it has become increasingly clear that long-term reliance on a single hosted platform introduces avoidable risks: platform lock-in, shifting policies, pricing changes, and potential external pressure.

To address this, we have decided to make a fresh start with Forgejo, a Git environment that is:
- Fully self-hostable,
- Open source by design,
- Easy to mirror, federate, and replicate by independent CommunityCoins teams,
- And explicitly not dependent on a single commercial provider.

In doing so, we arrived at a principle that aligns well with open-source and decentralised development:
- Host your own accomplishments as the primary source of truth,
- and mirror them to well-established public hubs (GitLab, GitHub, etc.) for visibility and convenience.

This approach preserves:
- Autonomy and long-term continuity,
- Resilience against platform-level disruptions,
- And broad discoverability for contributors and users.
