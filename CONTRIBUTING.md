# CONTRIBUTING

This Communitycoins hub/library operates on Forgejo, an open source Gitea fork. It serves to maintain and collect multiple projects that are releated to Communitycoins. 

The main structure in Gitea (Git Tea)/Forgejo, just as with Gitlab and Github, is an `Organisation`, which itself is not structured (it is just a list). The `Organisation` contains a non-structured set of `repositories` (again, just a list). A `repository` (short: repo) is a hierarchical set of `files`, usually to bundle a software project. 

Normaly there is no organisation of `Organisations` except that only maintainers can add organisations. For this purpose we maintain a single `Organisation` named [Communitycoins](/Communitycoins). It contains one `repository` named [README](https://git.communitycoins.org/Communitycoins/README) to bundle directions for readers and those that want to contribute.

Since a software project is never finished Forgejo serves to maintain project-`issues`, -`branches`, -`tags` and -`releases`. Before anything changes you need to tell us why. Your answer becomes an `issue`. Before you start to work on an `issue` or a set of issues you need to create a `branch`, which is a named copy of all the files in a `repository`.

Forgejo also uses the name `project` which is confusing because a Forgejo-project is a set of issues. So you cannot define a forgeo-project when there are no issues. Issues can be ideas or hints, but also bugs
