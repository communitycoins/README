# CONTRIBUTING

This Communitycoins hub/library operates on Forgejo, an open source Gitea fork. It serves to maintain and collect multiple projects that are releated to Communitycoins. 

The main structure in Gitea (Git Tea), just as with Gitlab and Github, is an `Organisation`. Normaly there is no organisation of `Organisations` except that only maintainers can add organisations. 

The main outline of the Communitycoins hub is described in 

has a project-asset that operates like a kanban board. All Communitycoin ideas can be structured here but first the idea must be wrapped as an issue. Issues are repo-specific. So they are also organisation (or user) specific. 

Although an issue can appear in multiple projects it cannot appear in multiple contexts:

| Context | Answer |
|------|----------|
| One issue in multiple Projects? | ✅ |
| One issue in multiple repos? | ✅ within the same organisation |
| Over multiple organisations? | ❌ |
| Projects can serve as global lens? | ❌ No, only per organisation |
| Crosslinks possible? | ✅ with organisation as hard boundary |
